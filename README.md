corpus-esaren
=============

A trilingual corpus to be used with [langid.py](https://github.com/saffsd/langid.py).
For now the 3 covered languages are Spanis, Arabic and English, hence es-ar-en. There are also 3 domains.

I try to keep the Named Entities to minimum, and I also try to keep them balanced between the 3 languages, so that langid's Information Gain algorithm can exclude them from its model building.
