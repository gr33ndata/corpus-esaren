Help Us Test Our Website: Win a T-Shirt
Posted 24 February 2014 12:29 GMT

We're redesigning the Global Voices website and would like your help figuring out if we are headed in the right direction. We want to hear from all readers, contributors, friends.

Students from the University of Washington's Human Centered Design and Engineering (HCDE) program are using Global Voices as a case study for an extensive usability testing process in three separate groups. Each group has prepared a different survey.

We will be asking some people to look at the current website and others to be looking at designs for a brand new site. If you would like to participate, please enter your name and email below.

We are offering one lucky person the chance to win a Global Voices T-shirt!

Thanks for your support!
